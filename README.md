# reto-genK-2023

This is my solution to Kair√≥s Gen K - VII Edition - 2023.

The task consisted of passing a series of coding challenges to obtain the URL to sign up for their internship.

Inside the 'Tests' folder you can see that I used Jest to simulate testing cases which my code had to pass.

Inside 'Problem2-versions' you can check out the evolution of the solution for Problem 2. First, I wrote code to pass the tests and then I started refactoring until the final solution, 'index2.js'.
